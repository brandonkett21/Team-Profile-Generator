# Team-Profile-Generator

I have designed a Team Profile Generator that will help business have a central location for their employees contact info.

This can be very helpful for businesses that are looking to work in a team and make it easy for employees to communicate.

I used node to run the app that will automatically create an html page if you hit enter on no more employees.

I set up 4 different html pages for each type of employee, also js files to generate answers, and test files to help when
running individual tests.

App.js is what you would run the app from when using Node.
